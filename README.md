## How to run

Examples are provided in the `examples/` directory and use an MQTT-based network to demonstrate our language distributed capabilities.

To run them, use the Docker Compose file provided in the root of the repository:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will expose an MQTT broker on port `1883`.

You can then run the main methods provided in each example.
